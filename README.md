# WEBFLIX (JavaScript Capstone Project)

> The JavaScript capstone project is about building our own web application based on an external API(TVmaze API: data about TV series and movies). TVmaze API was selected by the team, because it provides data about a topic that we both like, to enable us build the webapp around it. The webapp will have 2 user interfaces.
- A home page showing a list of items that you can "like."
- A popup window with more data about an item that you can use to comment on it

> In this activity, we worked as a team to prepare a Kanban board with a GitHub project. As this our very first group project in our Microverse journey, a very detailed template was provided by Microverse, using a special script prepared for the team.
